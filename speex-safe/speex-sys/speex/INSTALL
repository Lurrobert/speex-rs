Installing Speex is as easy as:

1. Using the autotools build system:

% ./configure [--prefix=<install-path>]
% make
% make install

Note that if you are using the code from Git, you will need to run "autogen.sh"
and then "configure".


2. Using the Meson build system:

% meson setup builddir [--prefix=<install-path>] [-Doption=value]
% meson configure builddir (to see configuration options and default values)
% ninja -C builddir
% ninja -C builddir install

The Meson build has been tested for Linux, macOS, iOS, Android and
Windows (MingW + MSVC) targets, both native builds and cross builds.

See meson_options.txt for a list of available configuration options.
